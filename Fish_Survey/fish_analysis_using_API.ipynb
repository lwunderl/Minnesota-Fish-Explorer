THE PRESENT WALLEYE POPULATION IS WELL REPRESENTED BY THE SAME YEAR CLASSES THAT WERE SAMPLED IN 82. LARGER WALLEYES MAKE UP THE PRESENT POPULATION WITH MANY FISH MEASURING 14.0 - 22.0 INCHES. THE 87 NETTING WAS DOMINATED BY I,V,VI, AND VIII AGE CLASS FISH WITH FEWER II AND III AGE CLASSED FISH. THE AGE CLASSES SAMPLED CLOSELY FOLLOW PAST WALLEYE FRY STOCKINGS AND TEND TO INDICATE LITTLE NATURAL REPRODUCTION OCCURRING. THE BLUEGILL CATCH DECLINED FROM 50.40/TRAPNET IN 82 TO 13.83/TRAPNET IN 87. THE PRESENT BLUEGILL POPULATION HAS A WIDE LENGTH FREQUENCY DISTRIBU- TION AND IS REPRESENTED BY SEVEN AGE CLASSES WITH THE II AGE CLASS SHOWING THE MOST STRENGTH.

       "     'narrative': \"<p>Lake Crystal is a 393-acre lake partially surrounded by the city of Lake Crystal on its southwest side in Blue Earth County.  Lake Crystal is shallow and highly productive, which is common in landscapes dominated by agriculture.  Much of the shoreline and riparian zone of Lake Crystal is developed.  A city owned park located on the southwest shore provides public access to the lake.  The sport fish community consists of black crappie, white crappie, northern pike, walleye, channel catfish, bluegill, and yellow perch.  The walleye population is maintained through stocking.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2002, 2007, 2008, and 2010.  The current management plan calls for walleye fry stocking to occur in even years.  Lake Crystal was surveyed the week of 8/8/2011 to monitor the fish community. <br> \\n <br> \\nAlthough gill net catch rates of walleyes in the 2011 survey (11.5/gill net) were the lowest observed catch rates since 1972, walleye numbers were still above average for lakes similar to Lake Crystal in 2011. Walleye catch rates declined from 57.0/gill net in the 2006 survey to 11.5/gill net in the 2011 survey. Gill netted walleyes ranged in length from 10.0 inches to 22.4 inches with an average of 16.3 inches. Size structure of walleyes was good, with 63% of the fish sampled being larger than 17.8 inches in total length.  <br> \\n <br> \\nThe northern pike population appears to be on the upswing in Lake Crystal. Prior to this survey, pike were in low abundance (i.e., 0.0/gill net and less than 0.5/trap net) dating back to the 1991 survey. In the 2011 survey, pike were captured at a rate of 6.3/gill net which is above average for lakes similar to Lake Crystal. Total length of northern pike sampled in gill nets ranged from 18.4 inches to 24.6 inches and averaged 21.1 inches. Although northern pike have not been stocked directly into Lake Crystal, northern pike were stocked in Mills Lake in 2003, 2004, and 2006 which is directly connected to Lake Crystal.  <br> \\n <br> \\nYellow perch catch rates for gill nets (3.3/gill net) and trap nets (0.5/trap net) were below average when compared to similar lakes and were consistent with historical catch rates.  Approximately 78% of the yellow perch sampled were between 8.0 and 10.2 inches, with no fish exceeding 10.2 inches.  <br> \\n <br> \\nCatch rates of black crappies in both trap nets and gill nets were very high at 28.6/trap net and 94.5/gill net. In comparison, catch rates in 2006 were 14.4/trap net and 11.5/gill net. Although catch rates of black crappie were extremely high compared to similar lakes, the size structure of the population was small. Black crappies ranged in length from 5.0 inches to 11.6 inches and averaged 5.9 inches in gill nets. Total length of black crappies captured in trap nets ranged from 4.0 inches to 11.5 inches and averaged 6.2 inches. Ninety-eight percent of black crappies captured in gill nets and 90% of black crappies captured in trap nets were less than 6.5 inches in total length. White crappies were sampled in both sampling gears. Although relative abundance was low (4.8/gill net and 1.3/trap net), this was the first time that white crappies have been sampled during a survey since the 1972 survey.  <br> \\n <br> \\nBlack bullhead catch rates in trap nets and gill nets were substantially higher than in the previous survey in 2006. In the 2006 survey, catch rates of black bullheads were 61.0/gill net and 6.8/trap net while the 2011 survey revealed increased black bullhead abundance (189.8/gill net and 159.4/trap net). Catch rates of black bullheads were above average when compared to lakes similar to Lake Crystal. The yellow bullhead population also appears to be increasing. Since 1996, yellow bullhead catch rates have not exceeded 1.7/trap net. 2011 trap net catch rates averaged 14.6/trap net. <br> \\n <br> \\nYellow perch catch rates for gill nets (3.3/gill net) and trap nets (0.5/trap net) were below average when compared to similar lakes. Approximately 78% of the yellow perch sampled were between 8.0 and 10.2 inches, with no fish exceeding 10.2 inches.  <br> \\n <br> \\nCommon carp numbers increased substantially from catch rates observed during the 2006 survey. Gill net catch rates of common carp increased from 2.5/gill net in 2006 to 30.5/gill net in 2011. Trap net catch rates of common carp increased from 0.6/trap net in 2006 to 8.5/trap net in 2011. The majority of common carp captured ranged from 9.0 to 15.0 inches in total length.  <br> \\n <br> \\nBigmouth buffalo, bluegill, channel catfish, and white sucker were present but occurred in low numbers. <br> \\n <br> \\nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lake Crystal and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future.  <br> \\n <br> \\nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \\n <br> \\nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \\n</p>\",\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>Five trap nets were set in Lake Crystal on 4/13/22 to assess the extent of winterkill following low dissolved oxygen levels recorded during the 2021-2022 ice season and observations of dead fish after ice-out. All five nets yielded a heavy catch consisting of on average: 300 Black Bullheads (6-7 inches), 8 Black Crappies (7-12 inches), 6 Yellow Perch (8-10 inches), 4 Walleye (12-22 inches), 3 Northern Pike (20-32 inches), 2 Common Carp (15-30 inches), 1 Bluegill (7-8 inches), 1 Bigmouth Buffalo (10-13 inches), and 1 White Sucker (13 inches). Based on these results, it was concluded that Lake Crystal experienced only a very limited winterkill in 2022.</p>'},\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>Lake Crystal is a 393-acre lake located within the town of Lake Crystal in northwest Blue Earth County. A city-owned public access is located on the west side of the lake within Robinson Park. The lake is shallow with a maximum depth of 8 feet. The lake has generally poor water clarity and frequent algal blooms caused by elevated nutrient levels and has a history of periodic winterkills. Approximately half of the shoreline has been altered to suit residential development. Nearshore woody habitat is common along the unaltered shorelines, but aquatic vegetation is sparse lakewide and of poor quality. County Ditch 56 flows into the lake near the public access and carries silt and elevated nutrients into the lake. A silt delta forms at the mouth and requires regular dredging to maintain depth near the access. Lake Crystal is primarily managed for Walleye and secondarily for Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch. Walleye fry are stocked annually. Additional Walleye fry and adult Black Crappie, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch are stocked following winterkill events. Lake Crystal is designated as a Tier-2 lake and will be surveyed as part of regularly scheduled monitoring program at a frequency of every 6 years.  <br> \\n <br> \\nA standard survey is used for sampling a wide range of fish species during the summer months using standard methods (i.e., standard time of year, set sampling stations, taking water clarity readings and oxygen/temperature profiles, etc.) and gears (i.e., lake survey gillnets, trap nets, and spring electrofishing for Largemouth Bass). The 2022 survey was completed the week of August 15, 2022, using 4 gill nets and 9 trap nets. Water quality parameters were also measured. <br> \\n <br> \\nA total of 44 Walleyes were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 11.0/net, indicating moderate to high numbers were present. The 2022 Walleye catch rate was the lowest since 1996. The average catch rate from 1996 to 2022 was 25.6/net. Walleye ranged from 9.5 to 26.2 inches with an average of 17.6 inches. Approximately 86% of Walleye sampled were larger than 15 inches and 25% exceeded 20 inches. An additional 70 Walleyes averaging 18.1 inches were sampled with the trap nets. Walleye from both gears were 1 to 8 years old with 7 year-classes present. The 3-year-old age group was the most abundant, accounting for over half the sample. Growth was fast with Walleye approaching 16 inches at year 3. Annual fry stocking continues to support an abundant Walleye population in Lake Crystal. <br> \\n <br> \\nBlack Crappie were common in the trap nets with a total of 141 sampled for a catch rate of 15.7/net. Since 1996, Black Crappie catch rates have varied from 11.2/net to 40.8/net with an average of 20.4/net.  The 2016 catch rate was 40.8/net. Black Crappie sampled in 2022 ranged from 5.5 to 15.2 inches with an average of 8.6 inches. Most Black Crappie were over 8 inches and about 13% were over 10 inches. Black Crappie numbers were also high in the gill nets with a catch rate of 14.8/net and a maximum size of 11.7 inches. Black Crappie from both gears were 1 to 5 years old with 2-year-old fish accounting for more than 71% of the sample. Black Crappie growth was fast with an average length of 9.1 inches at year 3. The Black Crappie population of Lake Crystal was of high quality in 2022 and anglers have reported good trips targeting them in recent years. <br> \\n <br> \\nOnly 9 Bluegills were sampled with the trap nets in 2022 for a catch rate of 1.0/net, indicating low numbers were present. Catch rates have averaged just 2.5/net since 1996. A lack of aquatic vegetation and suitable spawning habitat has limited the ability of Bluegills to reproduce and create a viable fishery in Lake Crystal. <br> \\n <br> \\nA total of 25 Yellow Perch were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 6.3/net which nearly matched the all-time high catch rate of 7.3/net in 2016. Catch rates have averaged just 3.7/net since 1996. Yellow Perch were small with an average of 7.6 inches. <br> \\n <br> \\nThe most abundant species sampled in 2022 was the Black Bullhead. Black Bullhead dominated both gill net (186.0/net) and trap net (399.2/net) samples. Extremely high numbers of Black Bullheads correlate with poor water quality and lake instability, and they often dominate the fish community following winterkills and other disturbances. Drastic improvements in water quality and habitat are needed in Lake Crystal in order to suppress Black Bullhead numbers. <br> \\n <br> \\nOther species sampled in 2022 include Bigmouth Buffalo (19.8/gill net), Common Carp (0.2/trap net), Northern Pike (1.8/gill net), White Crappie (0.2/trap net), White Sucker (0.8/gill net), and Yellow Bullhead (3.8/trap net). <br> \\n <br> \\nWater clarity was poor with a secchi reading of 1.5 feet due to dense algae. The dissolve oxygen and temperature readings ranged from 9.1 ppm and 73.9 degrees Fahrenheit at the surface to 7.4 ppm and 73.6 degrees Fahrenheit at 7 feet. No thermocline was detected. <br> \\n <br> \\nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lake Crystal and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. <br> \\n <br> \\nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \\n <br> \\nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \\n <br> \\n-Sky Wigen, fisheries specialist <br> \\n</p>\",\n",

Although an aeration system is operated on Lake Crystal, low oxygen conditions in the winter of 2000 - 2001 caused a temporary decline in the populations of black crappie and bluegill.  However, walleye populations were less impacted by the winterkill.  In the spring of 2001, 880 lbs. of yellow perch adults and 620,000 walleye fry were stocked into Lake Crystal.  In 2001 walleye gill net catch was 21 per net and was similar to 1996 survey (36 per net).  Most walleye were around 16 to 17 inches and the largest was 27 inches.  A number of young-of-year black crappie were caught in trap nets indicating good reproduction that should reestablish black crappie in Lake Crystal.  Lake Crystal has been aerated since 1979.  Frequent winterkill historically limited the abundance of some fish species.  The operation of the aeration system has significantly reduced the occurrence of winterkill.</p>',\n",

No northern pike were sampled during the survey.Bluegill are low in abundance but are large - many over 8 inches.  Others, 6 inches or smaller, should contribute to the fishery over the next several years.  Black crappie are very abundant.  The majority of crappie are between 5-7 inches, and almost 20% are between 9-13 inches.    A channel catfish population is emerging, with fish between 12-18 inches.  This should provide fishing opportunities for anglers seeking them.  Black bullhead are low in abundance, with fish between 8-12 inches making up most of the population.  </p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>Lake Crystal is a 393-acre lake partially surrounded by the city of Lake Crystal on its southwest side in Blue Earth County.  Lake Crystal is shallow and highly productive, which is common in landscapes dominated by agriculture.  Much of the shoreline and riparian zone of Lake Crystal is developed.  A city owned park located on the southwest shore provides public access to the lake.  The sport fish community consists of Black Crappie, White Crappie, Northern Pike, Walleye, Channel Catfish, Bluegill, and Yellow Perch.  The Walleye population is maintained through stocking.  <br> \\nWalleye <br> \\n <br> \\nWalleye catch rates (18.3/gill net) rebounded from 2011 (11.5/gill net) which were the lowest observed catch rates since the 1972 survey. The 2016 catch exceeded the 3rd quartile for lakes similar to Lake Crystal (Class 43).  Gill netted Walleyes ranged in length from 7.7 inches to 15.6 inches with an average of 10.4 inches.  Size structure indices indicate a young Walleye population and only 3 year classes (2013, 2014, and 2015) were sampled due to a strong winter-kill during 2013-2014.  Walleye fry were stocked in 2014, 2015, and 2016 following the winter-kill. <br> \\nNorthern Pike <br> \\n <br> \\nNorthern Pike have been sampled in low abundance (i.e., 0.0/gill net and less than 0.5/trap net) dating back to the 1991 survey, with the exception of the 2011 survey (6.3/gill net).  Northern Pike numbers in 2016 returned to more historic levels as only two Northern Pike (0.7/gill net), measuring 17.6 and 19.4 inches, were sampled with gill nets. Although Northern Pike are not stocked directly into Lake Crystal, Northern Pike were stocked in Mills Lake in 2003, 2004, and 2006 which is directly connected to Lake Crystal.  Northern Pike are more tolerant of low oxygen than many other game fish species and some may have survived the winter-kill of 2013-2014. <br> \\nBlack Crappie <br> \\n <br> \\nCatch rates of Black Crappies in both trap nets and gill nets were high in 2016 with 34.2/gill net and 40.8/trap net compared to 28.6/trap net and 94.5/gill net in 2011.  The 2016 trap net and gill net catch rates of Black Crappies exceeded the 3rd quartile for similar lakes for both sampling gears. Black Crappie size structure improved from 2011 when the majority of fish were small.  Black Crappies sampled in gill nets in 2016 ranged in length from 5.9 inches to 13.1 inches and averaged 8.5 inches. Total length of Black Crappies captured in trap nets ranged from 3.1 inches to 14.1 inches and averaged 8.7 inches.  White Crappies were sampled in low numbers (1.6/net) with trap nets in 2016.  White Crappies were also present in the 2011 survey (4.8/gill net and 1.3/trap net) for the first time since the 1972 survey. <br> \\nYellow Perch <br> \\n <br> \\nYellow Perch catch rates for gill nets (7.3/gill net) were between the 1st and 2nd quartiles for lakes similar to Lake Crystal and was the highest rate since 1982. Yellow Perch averaged 8.8 inches and ranged from 7.5 to 11.1 inches. <br> \\nYellow Bullhead <br> \\n <br> \\nBlack Bullhead catch rates in trap nets (69.4/trap net) and gill nets (112.3/gill net) were between the median and upper quartile for class 43 lakes and were lower than in the 2011 survey.  In 2006, catch rates of Black Bullheads were 189.8/gill net and 159.4/trap net.  Yellow Bullhead catch rates (8.8/trap net) also decreased from the 2011 survey (14.6/trap net), although they remain higher than recent surveys and exceed the upper quartile for class 43 lakes.  Size structure of Yellow Bullheads sampled with gill nets was good.  Yellow Bullheads averaged 9.0 inches and ranged from 6.5 to 14.3 inches. <br> \\nCommon Carp <br> \\n <br> \\nCommon Carp abundance decreased substantially from the 2011 survey.  Gill net catch rates of Common Carp decreased from 30.5/gill net in 2011 to 1.3/gill net in 2016.  Trap net catch rates of Common Carp decreased from 8.5/trap net in 2011 to 4.3/trap net in 2016.  Both trap net and gill net catch rates were between the lower and upper quartiles for class 43 lakes.  The majority of Common Carp captured were greater than 20 inches in total length. <br> \\n <br> \\nOther species <br> \\nBigmouth buffalo, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Golden Shiner, Hybrid Sunfish and White Sucker were present but occurred in low numbers. <br> \\n  <br> \\nAnglers can help maintain or improve the quality of fishing by practicing selective harvest. Selective harvest allows for the harvest of smaller fish for table fare, but encourages release of medium- to large-sized fish. Releasing these fish can help maintain balance in the fish community in Lake Crystal and provide anglers the opportunity to catch more and larger fish in the future. <br> \\n <br> \\nShoreline areas on the land and into the shallow water provide essential habitat for fish and wildlife that live in or near Minnesota's lakes. Overdeveloped shorelines cannot support the fish, wildlife, and clean water that are associated with natural undeveloped lakes. Shoreline habitat consists of aquatic plants, woody plants, and natural lake bottom soils.  <br> \\n <br> \\nPlants in the water and at the water's edge provide habitat, prevent erosion, and absorb excess nutrients. Shrubs, trees, and woody debris such as fallen trees or limbs provide good habitat both above and below the water and should be left in place. By leaving a buffer strip of natural vegetation along the shoreline, property owners can reduce erosion, help maintain water quality, and provide habitat and travel corridors for wildlife. <br> \\n <br> \\n-Sky Wigen, Fisheries Specialist <br> \\n</p>\",\n",

This population features well-balanced size and age structures, which provides excellent angling opportunities.  Bluegill and black crappie populations have rebounded following a 2001 winterkill event.  Most fish were less than age 5 and growth rates are good for both species. Given the populations size and age structure, the panfishing opportunities should continue to improve.  The channel catfish population also appears to be improving as catch rates continue to increase.  The size structure is good and the populations should provide good fishing for quality-sized catfish.</p>',\n",

An assessment of the fish population in Clear Lake was conducted in late August 2003 to monitor the fish community following the April 2000 reclamation.  Black crappie were abundant in the trap net catches.  Most black crappie were around 6 or 9 inches in length and should provide good fishing opportunities.  Most bluegill were around 6 inches long.  A few 14-inch walleye were captured and were likely from the 2001 fingerling stocking.  Carp were first observed in 2001 and in 2003 ranged from 15 to 25 inches.  No black bullhead were captured.  Largemouth bass are also present.</p>',\n",

The moderate perch population present is of unknown origin, but has provided good angling.  Perch are dominated by 3 year olds, with fewer 4 year olds present.  A large population of black bullheads is present, which is made up predominately of 1/4 lb. bullheads.  There is a small population of green sunfish present.\\n</p>'},\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>A resurvey was conducted at Clear Lake in 2011 to monitor the Lake's chemical, physical, and biological characteristics.  Clear Lake has had high catch rates of black bullhead and carp in the past, and was most recently chemically reclaimed with rotenone in 2000.  Net catches in 2011 indicated that a quality panfish population was now present at the Lake.  An aeration system is operated during the winter to reduce the likelihood and severity of winterkill at Clear Lake.  Clear's lakeshed (1,387 acres) was dominated by row crop agriculture.  Forest, mostly a thin fringe, made up the largest type of shoreline use in 2011.  The lake to lakeshed ratio was 1:6.  Most varieties of aquatic vegetation were ranked as rare, except for Filamentous Algae and cattail which were common, and sago pondweed which was classified as abundant.  For shoalwater substrates; sand was abundant and silt was common.  The shoreline was mostly undeveloped with only 6 homes/farms being counted.  A fishing pier is available for anglers at the County Park.     <br> \\n  <br> \\nGill nets sampled 3 walleye for a catch rate of 0.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was also low at 2.0/net.  Gill net catch rates from 2004 to 2011 (n=3) ranged from 0.8 to 7.5/net with an average of 3.4/net.  Catch rates from 1984 to 2011 (n=8), under various stocking regimes, ranged from 0.0 to 130.0/net with an average of 23.8/net.  Gill netted walleye were 7.1 to 15.9 inches long with an average of 10.6, in 2011.  Trap nets sampled 11 walleye ranging from 6.3 to 26.9 inches in length.  Aged walleye were 1 to 5 years old with 3 year-classes present.  All of the fish that were aged corresponded with stocked year-classes, which may indicate that natural reproduction was not significant at Clear Lake.  Age 1 (2010 year-class) fish made up the majority of the sample (64%), and had an average length of 7.3 inches at time of capture.  The latest fry stocking regime (1,000/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 2000.  The stocking regime was modified in 2010 with an additional 341 pounds of fall walleye fingerlings being stocked.  Approximately 125 six inch walleye were observed during spring night-time electrofishing for largemouth bass in 2011.  This likely indicated that the survival of the stocked fingerlings was substantial.  While some of these fish were netted in 2011, the year-class was likely too small to be effectively sampled by gill nets.  This year-class should be of an acceptable size to anglers within a couple of years.  Growth was fast.   <br> \\n   <br> \\nNorthern pike were not stocked following the reclamation and have never been gill netted at Clear Lake. <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 7 yellow perch for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was below the normal range for this type of lake, but the highest ever measured at Clear.  Yellow perch were not stocked initially following the reclamation in 2000, but were stocked in 2009 to compete with black crappie and to provide an alternate forage base for walleye.  Catch rates (n=8) from 1984 to 2011 were all low, ranging from 0.0 to 1.8/net with an average of 0.4.  Gill netted yellow perch were 5.3 to 7.8 inches long with an average of 6.3.  Yellow perch were 1 to 3 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Age 1 fish (2010 year-class) made up 88% of the total catch.  This also indicated that natural reproduction had occurred.  Growth was moderate.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 858 black crappie for a catch rate of 214.5/net, which was fifteen times higher than the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was also extremely high (298.0/net).  Catch rates (n=3) since the reclamation (2004, 2006, & 2011) were all high, ranging from 214.5 to 298.0/net with an average of 267.5.  In 2011, gill netted black crappie were 0.9 to 9.8 inches long with an average of 7.3.  Approximately 57% of the gill net catch was 8 inches or longer.  The trap net catch rate (76.6/net) was also well above the lake-class normal range, indicating a large population.  The 2006 trap net catch rate was also high at 91.4/net.  Catch rates from 2000 to 2011 (n=7) were all high ranging from 56.6 to 148.8/net with an average of 90.7.  Trap netted black crappie were 3.5 to 9.2 inches long with an average of 8.0.  Approximately 4% of the gill net catch and 2% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer, in 2011.  The netting in 2006 failed to sample any black crappie that were 9 inches or longer, with the oldest year-class being age 5.  Black crappie were estimated to be 1 to 7 years old with 7 year-classes present, in 2011.   At least four of the year-classes (2010, 2006, 2005, and 2004) appeared to be quite strong.  Growth was slow, with black crappie not reaching 9 inches in length until at least age 5.   <br> \\n   <br> \\nTrap nets sampled 440 bluegill for a catch rate of 55.0/net, which was well above the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate (35.0/net) was also high.  Catch rates from 1984 to 2011 (n=15) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 102.5/net with an average of 28.5.  The latest three catch rates (2004, 2006, & 2011) showed a possible increasing trend for bluegill at Clear Lake.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 3.2 to 8.6 inches long with an average of 7.1.  Approximately 72% of the catch was 7 inches or longer, while 10% were 8 inches or longer.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 1 to 6 years old with 6 year-classes present.  The 2007 year-class appeared to be particularly strong.  Growth was fast.  Standard shoreline seining collected a total of 1,492 YOY bluegill, which indicated good natural reproduction. <br> \\n <br> \\nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 25 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 18.8/hr.  The catch rate in 2007 was 7.2/hr.  Electrofished largemouth bass were 4.4 to 17.4 inches long with an average of 10.5.  Approximately 44% of the catch was 12 inches or longer, but only 3 fish were 15 inches or longer.  Largemouth bass were 1 to 10 years old with 7 year-classes present, indicating inconsistent recruitment.  Growth was moderate.  The lack of submergent vegetation, many years, and low oxygen concentrations during some winters was likely limiting this species at Clear Lake.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 11 carp for a catch rate of 2.8/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 9.0/net.  Catch rates (n=8) from 1984 to 2011 were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 9.0/net with an average of 2.2.  Gill netted carp were 11.5 to 26.1 inches long with an average of 18.4.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 218 black bullhead for a catch rate of 54.5/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2004 and 2006 catch rates were both 0.0/net.  After many years of not sampling any black bullhead, it appears that they have reestablished themselves at Clear Lake.  Gill netted black bullhead were 4.7 to 11.1 inches long with an average of 7.4.   <br> \\n</p>\",\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\\nClear Lake was chemically reclaimed in April 1990.  This population assessment was conducted to assess the success of the reclamation and the recent stockings.  Gear used included two each of 3/4, 1/2, and 1/4 inch trap nets.  Young of year walleye were abundant in trap nets averaging 109.50 in 1/2 inch trap nets, 27.00 in 3/4 and 1/2 inch trap nets.  Bluegill were abundant in 1/2 inch trap nets, averaging 54.50/trap net, with most being young of year.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers averaging 1.50 in 1/2 inch trap nets.  Only one young of year largemouth bass was sampled, but several young of year largemouth bass were observed swimming in the shoal waters.  Young of year largemouth bass observed were relatively large, about 8 inches in length.  Black bullheads were not sampled during the assessment, but two adult black bullhead were captured during walleye fingerling harvest in October 1990, indicating some survival through the reclamation.  Large numbers of fathead minnow were observed in the shoal waters, but none were sampled in netting.</p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>A standard survey was conducted at Clear in 2016 to monitor the Lake's fish population.  A total of seven different species were sampled in 2016, indicating low diversity.  The lake was well mixed with good levels of oxygen at all depths, allowing fish to use the entire lake.  The water clarity was poor (1.2' secchi disk reading) in 6/13/16, due to an intense algae bloom.  Clear Lake had been overrun by Black Bullhead and Common Carp in the past, and was most recently reclaimed with rotenone in 2000.  An aeration system was operated during the winter to reduce the likelihood and severity of winterkill at Clear Lake.  Winter oxygen levels still dropped dangerously low some years (2010, 2011, and 2014), especially at the north end of the lake.  A Brown County Park with a fishing pier was available to anglers.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled low numbers (6) Walleye for a catch rate of 3.0/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Clear.  The 2011 catch rate was also low at 0.8/net.  Historic catch rates (n=9), from 1984 to 2016 and under various stocking regimes, were highly variable ranging from 0.4 to 130.0/net with an average of 21.5.  Gill net catch rates, following the latest reclamation (n=4) ranged from 0.8 to 7.5/net with an average of 3.3/net.  Gill netted Walleye were 7.7 to 18.3 inches long with an average of 10.0.  Trap nets sampled 1 Walleye that was 25.6 inches long.  Fish were age-2 to age-7 with three year classes present.  All of the gill netted fish corresponded with stocked year classes.  This may indicate that natural reproduction was not significant at Clear Lake.  Age-2 fish (2014 year class) made up the majority of the sample (83%) and that year class was actually moderate in size.  Growth was slow.  The latest fry stocking regime (252,000 every other year) was initiated in 2006.  The stocking regime was modified in 2010 with hopes of producing a better Walleye fishery.  The plan stated that if the fall electrofishing catch rate for young of the year Walleye fell below 50/hr., then 252 pounds of fingerlings would be stocked into Clear Lake.  Fry and fingerlings were stocked in 2010, 2014, and 2016.  Fingerlings were not stocked in 2012 due to poor condition and slow growth of the 2010 year class.  The fingerling contingency was triggered 4 out of 4 times likely indicating that fry stocking was not working, possibly due to predation by the large population of Black Crappie.  Walleye gill net catch rates (2011 and 2016), during the latest regime (2010), ranged from 0.8 to 3.0/net with an average of 1.9.  A lack of forage, prior to 2016, could be what was limiting the Walleye fingerling stockings at Clear Lake. <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (30) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 15.0/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Clear and the highest ever measured at Clear Lake.  Yellow Perch were stocked in 2009 to compete with Black Crappie and to provide an alternate forage base for Walleye.  Historic catch rates (n=9) from 1984 to 2016 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 15.0/net with an average of 2.0.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.6 to 6.7 inches long with an average of 6.0.  Yellow Perch were all age-2, indicating inconsistent recruitment, but at least some natural reproduction was now occurring.  Growth was fast.     <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (48) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 24.0/net, which was above the normal range for lakes similar to Clear.  The 2011 catch rate was extremely high (214.5/net).  Historical catch rates (1984 to 2016) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 298.0 with an average of 96.2.  Catch rates (n=4) since the reclamation (2004, 2006, 2011, and 2016) were mostly high, ranging from 24.0 to 298.0/net with an average of 206.6.  In 2016, gill netted Black Crappie were 4.5 to 11.1 inches long with an average of 6.9.  Trap nets sampled high (1,099) numbers of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 122.1/net which was above the normal range.  The 2011 trap net catch rate was 76.6/net.  Every trap net catch rate since the reclamation was above the normal range, indicating a large population.  Historical catch rates from 1984 to 2016 (n=16) ranged from 0.0 to 148.8/net with an average of 60.7.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 3.4 to 11.4 inches long with an average of 7.0.  The overall size structure would be poor, but decent numbers of 10 inch fish were present.  Black Crappie were estimated to be age-1 to age-11 with seven year classes present.  At least two of the year classes (2013 and 2014) appeared to be quite strong, accounting for 40% and 55% of the catch, respectively.  Growth was moderate.     <br> \\n     <br> \\nTrap nets sampled low numbers (24) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 2.7/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Clear, but was also the second lowest on record since the reclamation.  The 2011 catch rate (55.0/net) was much higher.  Catch rates from 1984 to 2016 (n=16) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 102.5/net with an average of 26.9.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were 4.8 to 8.5 inches long with an average of 7.5.  Approximately, 88% of the trap net catch was 7 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were age-2 to age-7 years old with six year classes present.  All year classes appeared to be weak.  Growth was fast.  Marginal submergent plant habitat is likely a limiting factor on Bluegill at Clear Lake.  Low oxygen levels, in the northern part of the lake during severe winters, could also lead to mortality on Bluegill at Clear.  <br> \\nSpring night-time electrofishing, targeting Largemouth Bass, was not conducted in 2016, but trap nets sampled 2 fish.  Trap netted fish were 9.1 and 17.7 inches long.  Largemouth Bass were not aged.  This species may also be susceptible to winterkill during harsh winters, despite aeration.  A marginal aquatic plant community also limits this species.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled high numbers (213) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 106.5/net, which was well above the normal range for lakes similar to Clear and was one of the highest catch rates ever recorded in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area.  The 2011 catch rate was 2.8/net.  Catch rates (n=9) from 1984 to 2016 were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 106.5/net with an average of 13.8.  Gill netted Common Carp 0.1 to 21.9 inches long with an average of 12.1.  Trap nets sampled moderate numbers (32) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 3.6/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  Trap netted fish were similar in length to gill netted fish.     <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled high numbers (283) Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 141.5/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Clear.  The 2011 catch rate was 54.5/net.  The 2004 and 2006 catch rates were both 0.0/net.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 5.3 to 11.1 inches long with an average of 7.8.  Approximately 96% of the gill net catch was under 10 inches in length, indicating a poor size structure.  Trap nets sampled moderate numbers (291) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 32.3/net, which was within the normal range for this lake type.  Historical catch rates from 1984 to 2016 were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 594.3/net with an average of 54.3.  Trap netted Black Bullhead were 4.7 to 11.4 inches long with an average of 9.1.  It took 11 years for Black Bullhead to show up in Clear Lake following the reclamation, and another 5 years to become overly abundant.   <br> \\n</p>\",\n",

       "    {'narrative': \"<p>In 2017, fisheries management at Clear Lake near New Ulm switched to Northern Pike and Yellow Perch, species better suited to survive low oxygen winters in this shallow lake.  Adult Northern Pike were stocked in 2017, 2018, and 2019.  Yellow Perch were stocked in 2019.  Aeration was discouraged with hopes that the lake's abundant Common Carp population would eventually be reduced by a winterkill.  Oxygen testing during the 2018-2019 winter indicated that a winterkill could have occurred at Clear Lake.  Fish populations can fluctuate widely on winterkill lakes, depending on the frequency and severity of the latest winterkill.  Nets were set to document fish abundances following the somewhat severe 2018-2019 winter.  Low numbers of dead Common Carp were observed along the cattails following ice-out in 2019.  Net catches were as follows: <br> \\n <br> \\nNets sampled high numbers of Black Crappie (averaging 8.4 inches in length, and maximum length of 9.0 inches) and high numbers of Common Carp (ranging from 12.0 to 23.4 inches in length).  Low numbers of other game fish were also netted: Largemouth Bass (1 at 18.1 inches in length), Northern Pike (3, up to 20.7 inches in length), Walleye (6, up to 14.8 inches in length), and Yellow Perch (1).  Black Bullhead (8) were also captured in low numbers.  Bluegill were not netted in 2019.  Net catches and dead fish observations indicated that the 2019 winterkill had little impact. However, one day ice-out trap netting assessments are not always reliable indicators of species presence or fish abundance.  For the time being, anglers will likely have the best luck by targeting Crappie, with occasional catches of Walleye and Northern Pike.  Northern Pike abundance should increase over the next several years as stocked fish start reproducing. A fishing pier is available at the Brown County Lost Dog and Fox Hunters Park. <br> \\n</p>\",\n",

The 1990 post-reclamation assessment showed young-of-the-year bluegill at 2.0-2.9 inches and age 5 and 6 adults over 7.0 inches.  The 1990 year class dominated the sample again in 1991.  In 1990, abundant fathead minnows and zooplankton were observed in the shallows.  Bluegill growth was fast.  Black crappie were sampled in low numbers, averaging 1.25/trap net, compared to 1.50/trap net in 1990.  Anglers are reporting largemouth bass exceeding 1 lb.

Walleye are abundant, with 130 caught in a gill net, and 73.50/trap net.  Growth for walleye continues to exceed the state average.  Bluegill declined from 77.5/trap net in 1991 to 28.0/trap net.  Bluegill continue to be dominated by the fish that hatched the year of reclamation.  Age 1 bluegill are recruiting to the sampling gear with a median length of 4.1 inches.  Growth continues to be fast for bluegill, and angling was reported good the past year.  Black crappie remain low in abundance at 1.50/trap net compared to 1.25 and 1.50/trap net in 1991 and 1990, respectively.  Black crappie were dominated by age 2 fish with one yearling netted.  The low numbers of crappie may be influenced by walleye predation.  Walleye stomach contents contained large quantities of young of the year crappie and bluegill, which is not surprising considering the few forage species present.  Largemouth bass averaged 19.7/hour in 1992 spring electrofishing.  Three largemouth bass, 10.5-11.4 inches and 2 years old, were netted.  Growth continues to be fast for largemouth bass, exceeding the state average by 30%.  Three black bullhead, 8.0-9.4 inches, were sampled.  </p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>Clear is a small lake (251 acres) located south of New Ulm, in Brown County. A medium sized county owned access, with a single cement boat ramp, is present on the southeast shore. A fishing pier is available at the Lost Dog and Fox Hunters County Park. Clear has 3 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 8 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Clear is a class 43 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Swan and Winsted in McLeod County. This lake is occasionally aerated during the winter and anglers are advised to stay clear of the open water and thin ice signs when the system is operated.   <br> \\n <br> \\nFisheries management changed at Clear in 2017 when it was decided to primarily manage the lake for Northern Pike and Yellow Perch. These two species typically can survive lower winter oxygen levels than Bluegill and Largemouth Bass often do. Northern Pike adults were stocked in 2017, 2018, and 2019, while Yellow Perch (adults and yearlings) were stocked in 2019. Ice-out trap net catches in 2021 indicated that neither of those two species have become abundant, but the populations may need more time to develop. Pike and perch angling opportunities appear to be somewhat limited at this time. Northern Pike averaged 23 inches in length. Net catches for Walleye also indicated that a marginal population was present, but an average length of 20 inches was impressive. Walleye up to 27 inches in length are also present at Clear Lake. Trolling crankbaits should catch both Walleye and Northern pike in this turbid lake. Soaking a sucker minnow under a bobber off the fishing pier could also catch a pike. Panfish anglers know that Clear Lake has an abundant crappie population and ice-out trap netting seemed to confirm this in 2021. Black Crappie averaged 8 inches in length with good numbers of 8 and 9 inch fish being captured. The longest crappie sampled was 11 inches. A small minnow under a bobber should get some action from the crappies at Clear. Try along the cattails or off the fishing pier in the spring if you are after Black Crappie. A decent number of Bluegill were present in 2021 too, with many in the 7 and 8 inch length range. A teardrop tipped with a waxworm should get you a few sunfish for supper. Ice-out trap netting indicated that a moderate number of Common Carp were present at Clear Lake. Get out the ultralight action rod and a can of corn if you want to have some serious fun - fishing for carp! <br> \\n <br> \\nOther species that anglers may encounter include Black Bullhead, Hybrid Sunfish, and Largemouth Bass.      <br> \\n <br> \\nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Over harvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office.  Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office. Thanks and good fishing!</p>\",\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>A resurvey was conducted at Hanska in 2006 to monitor the lake's physical, chemical and biological charecteristics.  The lake's watershed was dominated by row crop agriculture.  Much of the shoreline was undevelped and had a thin fringe of trees before the crop fields began.  Submergent vegetation was rare in late summer, but emergent cattails were ranked as common.  Patches of curlyleaf pondweed may be more abundant in May and June.  Silt and sand were classified as common shoalwater substrates.  Aeration systems (2) are operated on each end of the lake with hopes of reducing the frequency and severity of winterkill.  Mild winters in recent years have also reduced the likelyhood of winterkill.  The latest partial winterkill occurred during the 2000-2001 winter.  Bluegill, black crappie, northern pike, walleye and channel catfish were stocked in 2001. <br> \\n <br> \\nHigh numbers of walleye were gill netted (47.0/net) averaging 13.7 inches.  Gill netted walleye were 11.5-21.5 inches long, but trap nets sampled fish up to 23.2 inches.  Approximately 98% of the gill net sample was 11.5 to 17.9 inches long.  Walleye fry are stocked every-other-year at Hanska.  Low numbers of large sized northern pike were sampled in 2006, as was the case in 2005.  Trap nets sampled more northern pike than gill nets did, with fish ranging in length from 27.2-37.1 inches.  Black bullhead were extremely abundant in the gill nets (197/net), but averaged only 6.4 inches.  The longest black bullhead surveyed was 8.3 inches.  Gill nets sampled high numbers of carp that averaged 14.5 inches.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were gill netted, for this type of lake, with fish ranging from 7.0-11.2  in length.  Black crappie only averaged 7.9 inches and few fish were over 9 inches.  Low to fair numbers of bluegill were trap netted (4.2/net) as was the case during the past several assessments.  Bluegill were 3.5-8.3 inches long averaging 5.3 inches.  Gill nets sampled few (2) channel catfish ranging in length from 20.4-25.6 inches.  During shoreline seining several young-of-th-year channel catfish were sampled, indicating that natural reproduction had occurred.  Catfish were last stocked in 2001.   </p>\",\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>A population assessment was conducted at Hanska Lake, a designated wildlife lake, in 2012 to monitor the fish community and assess the latest walleye stocking regime. An aerator is operated at each end of the lake during the winter to reduce the frequency and severity of winterkill events. No winterkill events have been reported in recent years. <br> \\n <br> \\nA total of 85 walleyes were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 17.0/net, indicating high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2011 was 14.0/net. Lengths ranged from 12.6 to 15.9 inches long with an average length of 14.0 inches. A total of 8 walleyes up to 16.5 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.7/net. Fish from both gears were either 3 or 4 years old, with over 96% being 4 years old from 2009 when walleye fry were stocked. Growth rates in 2012 were moderate. Four strong year-classes, all during stocked years, have been produced (2001, 2003, 2005, and 2009) since the partial winterkill in 2001, however naturally reproduced contributions cannot be ruled out.  <br> \\n <br> \\nTwo northern pike were sampled with the gill nets for a catch rate of 0.4/net, indicating low numbers were present for the 7th consecutive sample since 2001.Gill netted northern pike were 20.5 and 22.5 inches long. One 42.3 inch long northern pike was sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 0.1/net. <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled a total of 249 yellow perch for a catch rate of 49.8/net, indicating high numbers were present for the first time in 9 samples since 1997 (55.0/net). The catch rate in 2011 was 7.3/net. Lengths ranged from 4.5 to 11.8 inches with an average of 7.5 inches. It appears as though the yellow perch population in Hanska Lake has finally recovered from partial winterkill events in 1998 and 2001. Yellow perch were not reintroduced following either event. <br> \\n <br> \\nA total of 121 black crappie were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 24.2/net, indicating high numbers were present. No black crappies were sampled with gill nets in 2011. In 2012, gill netted black crappies ranged from 5.1 to 7.7 inches long with an average length of 6.5 inches. Trap nets sampled a total of 53 black crappies for a catch rate of 4.4/net, also indicating high numbers were present. Lengths ranged from 5.3 to 11.1 inches with an average of 7.3 inches. Black crappies from both gears ranged from 1-3 years old with 3 year-classes present. Age-1 fish from 2011 accounted for approximately 90% of the sample. Growth rates were fast. <br> \\n <br> \\nTrap nets sampled 115 bluegills for a catch rate of 9.6/net, indicating high numbers were present. Lengths ranged from 3.0 to 9.4 inches long with an average length of 7.4 inches. Approximately 77% of the trap net sample was over 8 inches. A total of 13 bluegills up to 9.3 inches long were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 2.6/net. Bluegills from trap nets were 1-3 years old with 98% being 3 years old from 2009. <br> \\n <br> \\nLargemouth bass were not sampled with trap or gill nets in the 2012 or 2011 sample. <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 18 common carp for a catch rate of 3.6/net, indicating high numbers were present. The catch rate in 2011 was 12.3/net. Lengths ranged from 18.6 to 29.1 inches long with an average length of 20.9 inches. A total of 19 common carp up to 30.0 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.6/net.  <br> \\n <br> \\nA total of 61 black bullheads were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 12.2/net, indicating moderate numbers were present. The catch rate in 2011 was 42.7/net. Black bullhead numbers have decreased considerably after averaging 295.4/net from 1999-2006 following the winterkill events in 1998 and 2001. Only 16 black bullheads were sampled with  trap nets in 2012 for a catch rate of 1.3, indicating low numbers were present. <br> \\n <br> \\nA total of 90 channel catfish were sampled with gill nets for a catch rate of 18.0/net, indicating high numbers were present and was the highest ever sampled in Hanska Lake. The next highest catch rate was 8.7/net in 2011. Channel catfish were sampled for the first time in 2001. Lengths ranged from 6.5 to 26.1 inches with an average of 20.8 inches. Over 74% of the sample was over 20 inches long. A total of 23 channel catfish up to 24.6 inches long were sampled with trap nets for a catch rate of 1.9/net. Fish from both gears ranged from 1-7 years old with 5 year-classes present. More than half the sample was from the 2008 year-class. Since channel catfish were only stocked once (2001), it appears there is now a self-sustaining population in Hanska Lake.  <br> \\n <br> \\nOther species sampled in 2012 include bigmouth buffalo, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and hybrid sunfish (Lepomis spp.).</p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\\nThis assessment was done to track the fishery, which is developing, following the 1989 reclamation.  Few fish were sampled in the1990 population assessment with only 3 perch, 1 northern and 25 crappie sampled.  Largemouth bass are now abundant averaging 63.33/trap net.  Largemouth bass are 6.5-7.4 inches and are age 1.  Black Crappie were abundant, averaging 233.00/gill net and 188.33/trapnet.  Crappies were dominated by young of the year and yearlings.  The yearlings exhibited normal growth, averaging 2.4 inches, and then grew extremely fast until the time they were sampled.  These fish ranged from 6.5-7.9 inches long in August.  Young of year fish grew very fast, ranging from 3.5-4.9 inches long in August.  The density of fathead minnows in 1990 and 1991 may explain the different crappie growth patterns in these two years (normal in 1990; fast for both year classes present in 1991).  Fatheads were very abundant in 1990, probably competing with the 1990 black crappie year class during the first year, so limiting their growth to the normal rate - even in an environment that appears vacant at first glance.  After their first year, the black crappie had grown large enough to use the fathead minnows as food, did so, and grew very quickly as a result.  As the fatheads were consumed, their competitive influence on the growth of the 1991 black crappie year class was much less than on the 1990 year class.  Bluegill were in low abundance, averaging 9.67/trap net.  Bluegill are growing fast.  Walleye were well represented in the gill net with 49 fish captured.  Walleye range in size from 6.5-15.9 inches.  Walleye yearlings dominated the netting with fewer 2 year olds sampled.  This indicates the 1990 yearling stocking was successful, and either the fry or fingerling (or both) stockings in 1990 were also successful.  Growth is above average for walleye, at 5.8 and 10.8 inches for age 1 and 2, respectively.  </p>',\n",

A single year class of 6-8 inch fish dominated.  Black crappie were caught at 19.3/trap net.  Some of these fish were 9-11 inches, with good numbers of small fish present.  Walleye were abundant, averaging 52.0/gill net.  Most of these fish were 12-14 inches in length.  Yellow perch were captured at 36/gill net, a considerable increase from the 0.5/gill net observed in 1992.  The majority of these fish appear to be members of a 1991 year class.Largemouth bass were abundant at 46/hour of electrofishing.  Largemouth bass were represented by 8-12 inch fish (89%) and 12-15 inch fish (11%).</p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>Despite concerns about black bullheads and carp, the recreational value of the Lake Hanska fish community remains high.  Walleye remain very abundant, with most fish exceeding 14 inches.  Walleyes are in excellent condition and may be difficult to catch because of the abundant forage in the lake.  Northern pike appear to have successfully reproduced in the lake and the fish are of quality size, averaging 25 inches in length and 3 pounds in weight.  Because of the shallowness of the lake, anglers should focus on cool water inlets that concentrate fish during the summer months.Yellow perch fishing should continue to improve, with the average perch at 9 inches in length.  Perch fishermen should be able to locate fish on some of the sand bars located in the west arm of the lake.  Bass fishermen should enjoy fishing Hanska, with the abundance of largemouth present.  The remaining cattail band around part of the lake will concentrate and hold many of these fish.  Black crappie numbers continue to be good, with many fish between 8-10 inches and many 6-7 inch fish coming up.  Spring and winter seem to provide the best angling for Hanska crappies.  Bluegill numbers have shown some decline, but young fish are present, suggesting natural reproduction is occurring.  Most of the population is made up of fish between 4 and 6 inches in length.  These fish should provide some angling over the next couple of years.</p>'},\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>Hanska is a large (1,794 acres) and shallow lake located near the City of Hanska in Brown County. A large state-owned access with a double cement boat ramp is located on the southeast shore. A smaller state-owned access with a cement boat ramp is located at the northwest end of the lake - north of Godahl. A moderate-sized county access with a cement boat ramp is located at the northwest end of the lake - on the north shoreline. Fishing piers are found at the two accesses on the northwest end and at the Hanska County Park on the east end of the lake. Hanska has 21 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 16 feet. There are dredged sections of the lake at the southeast and the northwest ends of the lake, but much of the mid-portion of the lake is closer to 6 feet in depth. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Hanska is a class 41 lake and other similar lakes in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area are Washington and Long (Grove City), both in Meeker County.  <br> \\n <br> \\nHanska Lake occasionally suffers from winterkill and fish populations can fluctuate widely depending on the severity of the latest event. The last severe winterkill was in 2001. Species that are more intolerant of low winter oxygen levels include Bluegill, Largemouth Bass, and Channel Catfish and these species tend to experience greater mortality during harsh winters. Hanksa is often aerated during the winter to provide small refuge areas for fish during severe winters. Aeration systems are present at the southeast and northwest ends of the lake. Anglers are encouraged to stay far back from the open water and thin ice signs during the winter.  <br> \\n <br> \\nWalleye were sampled in good numbers in 2021, with fish averaging 16 inches in length and maxing out at 23 inches. Walleye tend to do well in the turbid waters of Hanska Lake. Trolling crankbaits should do the trick as submergent vegetation is often sparse at this lake. A leech under a bobber or a jig and a minnow are other local favorite techniques for catching Walleye. In recent years, Black Crappie have become a larger part of the angler's catch as their numbers have increased during the last two surveys (2017 and 2021). The fishing pier at the county park is a great place to try a tube jig tipped with a small minnow to catch crappie in the spring.  <br> \\n <br> \\nChannel Catfish were abundant in 2021 with gill netted catfish averaging 14 inches in length. The longest Channel Catfish sampled in 2021 was just under 28 inches. Shore fishing towards sunset with a piece of chicken liver laying on the bottom should provide some action from a hungry channel cat. Bluegill were not abundant in 2021, but large sized fish were definitely present. Almost half the Bluegill sampled in the trap nets were 8 inches or longer, with maximum length being an impressive 10 inches. Try a teardrop jig with a waxworm along the shorelines, up under the tree branches, for both Bluegill and crappie in the spring. You may even get a nice perch using this technique. Although Yellow Perch were not sampled in good numbers, a few 9 to 10 inch fish were present that could be considered a bonus catch while fishing Hanksa Lake.  <br> \\n <br> \\nOther species that anglers may encounter include Bigmouth Buffalo, Black Bullhead, Common Carp, Freshwater Drum, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Largemouth Bass, White Sucker, and Yellow Bullhead. Of interest, this was the first time that Freshwater Drum were sampled at Hanska. As a new member of the fish community and opportunistic forager, Freshwater Drum will provide angling opportunities and make great table fare for anglers who take the time to fillet carefully and remove the red tissue along the fish's lateral line. <br> \\n <br> \\nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>\"},\n",

This population assessment is in response to evaluate the success of the reclamation and to assess the introduction stockings.  Few fish were sampled in netting, with none captured in gill nets and one northern pike and three yellow perch sampled in 3/4 inch trap nets.  Additional 1/2 inch and 1/4 inch trap net sets were made to sample young-of-year fish.  A few black crappie young-of-year and many fathead minnows were captured.  Other species sampled, which apparently survived the reclamation, include green sunfish and stickleback.  Species introduced but not sampled include walleye, largemouth bass and bluegill.\\n\\n</p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>In 2011, a population assessment was conducted at Hanska, a designated wildlife lake, to monitor the fish population.  Two aeration systems were operated during the winter to reduce the likelihood and severity of winterkill, with the most recent partial winterkill occurring in 2001.  A lack of winterkill over the last decade could also have been the result of several mild winters and/or higher water levels.  A reduced number of nets were set in 2011, due to the July 1st government shutdown.  A fishing pier is present at the County Park on the east end of the lake.     <br> \\n  <br> \\nGill nets sampled 42 walleye for a catch rate of 14.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 47.0/net.  Gill net catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (n=7) were variable, ranging from 4.5 to 47.0/net with an average of 18.2/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17), under various stocking regimes, ranged from 0.0 to 54.0/net with an average of 21.5/net.  Gill netted walleye were 8.2 to 20.1 inches long with an average of 9.9, in 2011.  Approximately 90% of the gill net sample was less than the 10 inches in length.  Aged walleye were 2 to 6 years old with 4 year-classes present.  Approximately 98% of the fish that were aged corresponded with stocked year-classes, which may indicate that natural reproduction was not significant at Hanska Lake.  Age 2 fish made up the majority of the gill net catch (93%), indicating a strong year-class.  The latest fry stocking regime (1,000/littoral acre every-other-year) was initiated in 2001.  Initial growth was slow for the 2009 year-class, but those fish should be of a more acceptable size to anglers within a year or two.   <br> \\n <br> \\nNorthern pike were not sampled in gill nets or in trap nets, in 2011.  Gill net catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (n=7) ranged from 0.0 to 4.3/net with an average of 0.8.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) ranged from 0.0 to 5.5/net with an average of 0.9.  Only 3 northern pike have been gill netted in the last six assessments (2002-2011), indicating that recruitment is poor most years.  Past assessments, looking at fall trap netting data, has shown low numbers of large sized northern pike to be present in Hanska.    <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 22 yellow perch for a catch rate of 7.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2011 catch rate was the highest recorded since the partial winterkill in 2001.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 55.0/net with an average of 14.4.  Gill netted yellow perch were 6.6 to 10.1 inches long with an average of 8.95.  Approximately 41% of the gill net sample was 9 inches or longer.    <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets did not sample any black crappie in 2011.  The trap net catch rate was 0.6/net in 2011 and 2.5/net in 2006, both indicating that low numbers were present.  Trap net catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (n=7) were mostly low ranging from 0.6 to 16.8/net with an average of 4.4.  In 2011, trap netted black crappie were 8.1 to 8.7 inches long with an average of 8.4.  Black crappie were estimated to be 2 to 3 years old with 2 year-classes present, in 2011.  Growth was fast.    <br> \\n    <br> \\nTrap nets sampled 17 bluegill for a catch rate of 3.4/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate (4.2/net) was also low.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 166.0/net with an average of 20.2.  Catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (n=7) were all low, ranging from 0.5 to 4.8/net with an average of 2.9.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 6.9 to 8.1 inches long with an average of 7.4.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 3 to 5 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Growth was fast.     <br> \\n <br> \\nLargemouth bass were not sampled in gill nets or in trap nets, in 2011.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 37 carp for a catch rate of 12.3/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake, and indicated that high numbers were present.  The 2006 catch rate was even higher at 24.0/net.  Catch rates (n=17) from 1983 to 2011 were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 36.0/net with an average of 5.8.  Catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (n=7) ranged from 0.0 to 24.0/net with an average of 5.5.  Gill netted carp were 12.7 to 26.3 inches long with an average of 17.6.  Carp were the most abundant species sampled in trap nets (9.6/net) in 2011. <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 128 black bullhead for a catch rate of 42.7/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rates was over four times higher at 197.8/net.  Trap nets sampled 5.2/net in 2011 and 143.8/net in 2006.  The gill net catch rate and the trap net catch rate were both the lowest on record following the 2001 partial winterkill.  Gill netted black bullhead were 7.1 to 10.8 inches long with an average of 8.6.     <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 26 channel catfish for a catch rate of 8.7/net, which was the highest ever measured at Hanska.  Catch rates from 2001 to 2011 (N=7) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 8.7/net.  Channel catfish were 12.8 to 23.7 inches long averaging 17.7.  Approximately 77% of the gill net sample was 16 inches or longer.  A small sub-sample (6 fish) of channel catfish was aged and those fish were 3 to 6 years old with 3 year-classes being present.  This data indicated that natural reproduction may be occurring within Hanska Lake.  Channel catfish (yearlings and fingerlings) were only stocked one time (2001), at Hanska. <br> \\n</p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>A standard survey was conducted at Hanska Lake the week of June 19, 2017 to monitor the fish population and to do a preliminary evaluation of the 2013 Walleye stocking regime.  Gill nets and trap nets were set to sample the fish community.  The 2013 lake management plan lists Walleye as the primary management species while, Channel Catfish, Bluegill, and Black Crappie are listed as secondary species.  In 2017, a total of 14 species, plus Hybrid Sunfish, were sampled in the gill nets and trap nets.  Catch rates were compared to other similar lakes across the state.  Hanska Lake's dissolved oxygen levels were adequate for fish use, from top to bottom, on 6/19/17.  The water clarity was limited, with a secchi disk reading of 2.3 feet, due to algae.  A fishing pier was available at the Hanska Lake Brown County Park on the east side of the lake.  Smaller fishing piers, at accesses on the Northwest side of the lake, were also available.  Hanska has a history of winterkill with a severe kill occurring in 2001, and a lighter event occurring in 2014.  Aerators, one at the northwest end and the other on the southeast end, are sometimes operated at Hanska to reduce the likelihood and severity of winterkill.  Fish populations can fluctuate widely on winterkill lakes depending on the frequency and severity of the latest kill.  Hanska Lake is a designated Wildlife Lake with drawdown capabilities.  Curlyleaf Pondweed, a non-native aquatic submerged plant, can reach nuisance levels in May and June in various parts of the lake.  Hanska is a long (7 miles) and shallow lake, and with its NW to SE orientation, is subject to big waves on a windy day.  Areas on the NW and SE ends have been dredged to 10 to 12 feet, but most of the center of the lake is only 5 to 6 feet deep.    <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled low to moderate numbers (22) of Walleye for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 17.0/net.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were generally high, ranging from 0.0 to 54.0/net with an average 20.4.  Different stocking amounts and periods of no stocking occurred during these 34 years.  The latest Walleye fry stocking regime (1,773,000 fry two out of three years) was initiated in 2013.  Fry were stocked in 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017.  In 2017, gill netted Walleye were 10.4 to 26.2 inches long with an average of 13.9.  Approximately 68% of the gill net sample was between 12.0 and 14.9 inches in length, but only 9% were 15.0 inches or longer, indicating a mediocre size structure.  Trap nets sampled almost as many (19) Walleye as the gill nets did, which is rare, with a maximum length of 28.4 inches.  Walleye, from both gears, were age-1 to age-12 with seven year classes present.  Gill net aged fish matched up 100% with stocked years and approximately 94% of the trap net aged fish matched up with stocked years also.  This may indicate that natural reproduction is not significant at Hanska Lake.  Assessments in 2011 and 2012 also indicated that natural reproduction may not be significant.  The inability to separate fry stocked Walleye from naturally reproduced fish, during stocked years, confounds potential evaluation.  Walleye anglers could expect fair fishing at Hanska. <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled low numbers (1) of Northern Pike for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  This catch rate indicated that recruitment was very low.  The 2012 catch rate was also low at 0.4/net.  Historical catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 5.5/net with an average of 0.9.  The gill netted Northern Pike was 17.5 inches long.  Trap nets did not sample any Northern Pike in 2017.  Inadequate spawning habitat and hot summer water temperatures may be limiting the pike population at Hanska.   <br> \\nTrap nets sampled moderate numbers (181) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 15.1/net, which was above what might be expected for this lake type.  The 2012 catch rate was 4.4/net.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 188.3/net with an average of 25.1.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 5.1 to 11.3 inches long with an average of 9.5.  Approximately 82% of the trap net catch was 9 inches or longer.  Gill nets sampled low numbers (1) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 0.2/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 24.2/net.  Historic gill net catch rates (n=19) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 223.0/net with an average of 23.3.  The trap net size distribution indicated that multiple year classes were present and that a quality population was present.  Good numbers and sizes of crappie were present, but it may take a little searching to find them in this 1,700 acre lake. <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled high numbers (42) of Channel Catfish for a catch rate of 8.4/net.  The 2012 catch rate was 18.0/net.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) ranged from 0.0 to 18.0/net with an average of 2.3.  In 2017, gill netted Channel Catfish were 6.6 to 25.8 inches long with an average of 19.5.  Approximately 55% of the gill net catch was 20 inches or longer.  The size distribution indicated that multiple year classes were present.  Trap nets sampled fish up to 26.8 inches in length.  The one year stocking of Channel Catfish, in 2001, was highly successful and the population is now naturally reproducing and sustaining themselves.  A light winterkill, in 2014, followed by a summerkill that same year, likely reduced Channel Catfish numbers at Hanska Lake, but the population likely rebounded in time for the 2017 assessment.  Catfish anglers should expect good action from these easy to catch, hard fighting, and delicious tasting fish.   <br> \\n <br> \\nTrap nets sampled low numbers (65) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 5.4/net which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was 9.6/net.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 166.0/net, with an average of 18.9.  In 2017, trap netted Bluegill were 3.4 to 9.9 inches long with an average of 7.6.  Approximately 67% of the trap net sample was 7 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  The size distribution indicated that multiple year classes were present, but recruitment would not be considered consistent.  Bluegill anglers may want to target these fish in the spring and early summer, when they should be more concentrated and easier to locate. <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled low numbers (9) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 1.8/net, which was below what might be expected for this type of lake.  The 2012 catch rate was much higher at 49.8/net.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were variable, ranging from 0.0 to 54.4/net with an average of 15.6.  In 2017, gill netted Yellow Perch were 6.3 to 10.5 inches long with an average of 8.7.  The size distributions and a low catch rate indicated inconsistent reproduction.  Some quality sized fish were present for anglers, but numbers appeared to be quite low.  <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled high numbers (146) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 29.2/net which was above what might be expected for this lake type and the second highest ever recorded at Hanska.  Historic gill net catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 36.0/net with an average of 6.9.  Gill netted fish were 16.0 to 27.6 inches long with an average of 19.1.  Trap nets also sampled high numbers (84) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 7.0/net, which was above what might be expected for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates (n=19) were also quite variable, ranging from 0.0 to 24.0/net with an average of 3.8.  Trap netted Common Carp were 9.7 to 29.6 inches long with an average of 19.3.  Size distributions likely indicated that at least four year classes were present.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (134) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 26.8/net, which was within what might be expected for this type of lake.  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2017 (n=19) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 374.0/net with an average of 139.6.  Gill netted Black Bullhead were 9.9 to 12.2 inches long with an average of 11.0.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (54) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 4.5/net, which was within what might be expected for this lake type.  Trap netted fish were 10.1 to 13.0 inches long.  Both size distributions indicated inconsistent recruitment.   <br> \\n <br> \\nAdditional species sampled in the standard gear included Bigmouth Buffalo, Brown Bullhead, Golden Shiner, Green Sunfish, Hybrid Sunfish, Yellow Bullhead, and White Sucker. <br> \\n</p>\"},\n",
       "    {'narrative': '<p>The fish community of Hanska Lake continues to decline.  Northern pike and walleye offer the most in gamefish angling opportunities.  Both walleye and northern pike averaged 1/gillnet (gn), down from 9/gn and 5.5/gn respectively in 1997.  Panfish numbers have declined significantly with black crappie averaging 3.2/trapnet (tn), yellow perch 0.25/gn and bluegill not sampled.  Black bullhead are dominating the fishery at 472.5/gn and 85.9/tn, with smaller fish showing a strong increase compared to prior surveys.                      </p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\\nAn excellent walleye population has developed in Hanska Lake, since the last winterkill (1984).  The abundant age 4 group is from the 1984 fry stocking, and the well represented age 1 and age 2 groups are from natural reproduction.  Walleyes averaged 37.60/gill net, which exceed the state median by over ten times.  There is an excellent size distribution, with 25% of the fish sampled exceeding 17 inches.  Yellow perch average 10.60/gill net compared to 29.60/gill net in the 1983 survey.  Perch are represented by ages 1-4 compared to the 3 and 4 year olds sampled in 1983.  Apparently, perch survived the ‘84 winterkill, with perch last stocked in 1982.  Black crappie were not sampled in 1988.  Black crappie were well represented in the ‘83 survey with 1 year olds 7.0-9.4 inches.  Black crappie were not stocked after the 1984 winterkill.   Black bullhead, white sucker, and bigmouth buffalo have remained unchanged since the 1983 survey, and are all abundant.  Carp have shown a large increase, now averaging 36.00/gill net compared to only one sampled in 1983.  Orangespot sunfish and green sunfish were abundant in the 1983 netting compared to only one orangespot sunfish sampled and no green sunfish sampled in the 1988 netting.  </p>',\n",

An assessment of the fish community in Lake Hanska was conducted in early September 2003.  Walleye stockings of the 2001 year-class as fry, fingerlings, and yearlings have produced a sizeable walleye population consisting entirely of fish from this single year-class.  Walleye catch per gill net was well above normal levels for class 41 lakes.  Most walleye were around 12 to 15 inches.  Black bullhead catch in both gill nets and trap nets was extremely high, continuing the high catches first observed in 1999 after being low from 1993 though 1997.  Black bullhead ranged in size from 4 to 14 inches with most trap nets captured fish around 7 inches.  Trap net catches of black crappie, walleye, and white sucker were above normal.  Black crappie were mostly around 7 inches long with some up to 9 inches.  Bluegill were mostly 7 inches.  Northern pike, channel catfish, and largemouth bass also provide some angling opportunities.  </p>',\n",

       "    {'narrative': '<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\\nLargemouth bass are abundant, averaging 16.00/gill net compared to 63.33/trap net in 1991.  Bass continue to be represented by one cohort, which had a median length of 7.0 inches in 1991 compared to the 9.5 inch bass now present.  The two year olds present are expected to enter the creel next year as 11.0-12.0 inch fish.  Black crappie remain abundant at 78.75/trap net compared to 188.33/trap net in 1991.  Both year classes, which dominated in 1991 as young of the year and yearlings, continue to dominate as 1 and 2 year olds.  Growth remains good averaging 5.6 inches at age 2 compared to the state median of 4.8 inches.  Angling for crappie should increase next year, as they become acceptable size.  Bluegill have grown enough to become vulnerable to survey gear.  Bluegills averaged 9.67/trap net in 1991 compared to 166.00/trap net in 1992.  The median length for bluegill is 5.5 inches.  Bluegills netted are represented by 1 and 2 year olds.  Growth has been fast, averaging 4.9 inches at age 2 compared to the state average of 3.4 inches.  Anglers should begin harvesting bluegills next year with many bluegills > 6.0 inches present.  Walleye have declined from 49.0/gill net in 1991 to 15.5/gill net.  Walleye netted in 1991 were represented by 1 and 2 year olds compared to ages 1-3 now present.  The large peak in the length distribution that appeared from 12-14\" in the1991 survey did not carry through to the 1992 survey, suggesting that larger fish have been harvested by anglers.  Growth is average for 2 year olds, but well above state averages for ages 1 and 3.  Few northern pike are present, with 1 fish netted in 1991 compared to none in 1992.  Yellow perch are in low abundance, with only one fish netted compared to eleven sampled in 1991.  Hybrid sunfish and green fish have increased, averaging 47.5 and 21.5/trap net, respectively.  Only a few green sunfish were netted in 1991.  Carp averaged 24.0/trap net in 1991 compared to 3.5/trap net now.  Carp are represented by 12.0-18.5 inch fish compared to the 8.5-11.4 inch fish sampled in 1991.  Black bullhead were first netted in 1991 with 4 fish sampled, following the 1989 reclamation of Hanska Lake.  Black bullhead now (1992) average 16.5/gillnet, and are dominated by 7.5 to 10.4 inch fish.</p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>A resurvey was conducted at Sleepy Eye Lake in 2011 to monitor the Lake's chemical, physical, and biological characteristics.  Sleepy Eye was reclaimed with rotenone in 1993 and a significant recreational fishery has developed.  Frequent winterkill was noted as a limiting factor in past Lake Management Plans, but the last reported winterkill event was in 1986.  Dredging, aeration, reclamation, reductions in carp and bullhead, mild winters, and increases in the abundance of submergent vegetation may all have been responsible for the lack of winterkill over the last 25 years.  Sleepy Eye's lakeshed (959 acres) was dominated by row crop agriculture.  The lake to lakeshed ratio was roughly 1:4.  Submergent vegetation was plentiful at Sleepy Eye Lake in 2011.  The vegetation survey ranked coontail, muskgrass, and sago pondweed as common while northern watermilfoil, another native species, was classified as abundant.  Dense beds of curlyleaf pondweed, an exotic - invasive species, were present in late June.  For shoalwater substrates, sand and silt were rated as being common.  Much of the shoreline was undeveloped with only 6 homes being counted.  A fishing pier was present at the County Park on the northeast shore and a swimming beach was present on the southeast shore.    <br> \\n    <br> \\nGill nets sampled 8 walleye for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 0.0/net.  Only one other walleye has been sampled in gill or trap nets since the 1993 chemical reclamation.  Walleye were last stocked into Sleepy Eye Lake in 1981, so the origins of the 2011 fish were unknown.  In 2011, walleye were 17.9 to 25.2 inches long with an average of 22.1.  Gill netted walleye were 4 to 10 years old with 4 year-classes being present.  Growth was fast.     <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 15 northern pike for a catch rate of 2.5/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was five times lower at 0.5/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) ranged from 0.5 to 26.5/net with an average of 7.5.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2011 (n=13) ranged from 0.5 to 26.5/net with an average of 9.1.  In 2011, gill netted northern pike were 18.9 to 31.9 inches long with an average of 23.5.  Trap nets sampled 1 northern pike that was 33.3 inches long.  Northern pike were 2 to 4 years old with 3 year-classes present.  Northern pike fry were stocked annually, except for 2007, which indicated that natural reproduction was occurring.  Growth was fast.  A robust fishery has been slow to redevelop following the partial summerkill in 2003.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 44 yellow perch for a catch rate of 7.3/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was 6.0/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 139.5/net with an average of 36.8.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2011 (n=13) were also highly variable ranging from 1.5 to 139.5/net with an average of 44.0.  Gill netted yellow perch were 5.0 to 9.2 inches long with an average of 6.0.  Only 1 fish was 8 inches or longer.  Yellow perch were 2 to 6 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age 3 fish (2008 year-class) made up 73% of the gill net catch.  Yellow perch are likely an important forage fish for predators at Sleepy Eye Lake.  <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 204 black crappie for a catch rate of 34.0/net, which was above the normal range for this type of lake.  It was also the highest catch rate following the 1993 chemical reclamation.  The 2006 catch rate was also high (18.0/net).  Gill net catch rates from 1983 to 2011 were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 71.3/net with an average of 12.7.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2011 ranged from 0.0 to 34.0/net with an average of 8.6.  In 2011, gill netted black crappie were 5.1 to 9.5 inches long with an average of 5.9.  Only 1 fish was 8 inches or longer.  The trap net catch rate (9.8/net) was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 trap net catch rate was approximately ten times lower at 0.9/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 169.8/net with an average of 14.1.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2011 (n=13) ranged from 0.0 to 13.6/net with an average of 3.7.  Trap netted black crappie were 5.2 to 7.9 inches long with an average of 5.9.  In 2011, black crappie were estimated to be 3 to 7 years old with 5 year-classes present.   Only one of the year-classes (2008) appeared to be strong, accounting for 98% of the aged fish.  Growth was slow.     <br> \\n <br> \\nTrap nets sampled 477 bluegill for a catch rate of 53.0/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 catch rate was also high at 71.7/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2011 (n=17) were highly variable ranging from 4.5 to 125.5/net with an average of 35.7.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2011 (n=13) ranged from 14.9 to 71.7/net with an average of 34.7.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 3.9 to 7.8 inches long with an average of 6.0.  Approximately 58% of the trap net catch was 6 inches or longer, while 4% of the catch was 7 inches or longer.  In 2011, trap netted bluegill were 3 to 7 years old with 5 year-classes present.  Age 3, 4, and 5 fish were well represented, accounting for 86% of the trap net sample.  Growth was moderate.     <br> \\n    <br> \\nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled 49 largemouth bass for a catch rate of 56.0/hr.  The catch rate in 2006 was 91.4/hr.  Electrofished largemouth bass were 7.1 to 20.6 inches long with an average of 13.5.  Approximately, 61% of the sample was 12 inches or longer and 39% was 15 inches or longer.  The catch rate and the size distribution indicated that a quality population was present.  Trophy sized largemouth bass were also present, with two fish being at least 20 inches long.  Largemouth bass were 2 to 11 years old with 10 year-classes present, indicating good natural reproduction.  Growth was moderate to fast. <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 2 channel catfish for a catch rate of 0.3/net.  Channel catfish were 12.5 and 24.6 inches long.  Channel catfish fingerlings (6,090) were last stocked in 2008 and were no longer stocked after that year.  Channel catfish were 3 and 9 years old.     <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 259 black bullhead for a catch rate of 43.2/net, which was within the normal range for this type of lake.  The 2006 gill net catch rate was similar at 60.0/net.  The 2011 trap net catch rate was 47.1/net.  Although black bullhead were still the most abundant fish gill netted and second most abundant fish trap netted, they no longer dominated the net catches as they did in the 1980's and early 1990's.  In 2011, gill netted black bullhead were 6.5 to 12.0 inches long with an average of 9.7.  Approximately 7% of the gill net catch was 11 inches or longer.     <br> \\n  <br> \\nCarp were not netted in 2011, and have not been sampled in Sleepy Eye Lake since 1992. <br> \\n</p>\",\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>     The 1993 reclamation of Sleepy Eye Lake effectively created populations of game fish desired by anglers.  The 1998 fisheries assessment showed that Sleepy Eye Lake offers very good angling opportunities for northern pike, bluegills and black crappies.  While the average growth rates of the sampled pike, bluegills and crappies were above average, few fish of quality length were sampled.  This is due, in part, to the relatively new fish community in the lake following the 1993 reclamation which eliminated most of the fish in the lake at that time.  However, the current lack of larger, quality size fish in Sleepy Eye Lake, is also related to angler harvest of pike, bluegills and crappies as soon as the fish reach an acceptable size.  Anglers should practice catch and release or selective harvest by voluntarily limiting how many fish they remove from the lake.</p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>A fishery population assessment was conducted on Sleepy Eye Lake in August 2003 to monitor the fish community.  After reclamation in 1993, a quality fishery developed in Sleepy Eye Lake.  Northern pike had been captured at moderate to high levels from 1994 through the August 2003 assessment.  Shortly after the assessment a summer kill of northern pike occurred likely due to high water temperature and low dissolved oxygen levels.  The summer kill was limited exclusively to northern pike.  Other species were unaffected.  Northern pike adults were stocked in fall 2003 to reestablish pike in Sleepy Eye Lake.  Future stockings should reestablish a quality northern pike fishery.  In 2003 most pike were only 2 years old and around 20 inches long.  Bluegill are common with fish up to 8 inches present.  Black crappie are present at a low abundance, the largest are around 10 inches.  Other species present include yellow perch, largemouth bass and black bullhead.  </p>',\n",

Adult game fish were stocked in the spring, and from age-growth analysis, many of the fish sampled appear to be from these stockings.  Black crappies now average 2.67/trapnet, compared to 169.75/trapnet in ?83.  White crappies were not sampled, but averaged 45.00/trapnet in ?83 netting.  Bluegills average 12.5/trapnet, compared to 125.50/trapnet in ?83.  In ?83, bluegills, black crappie, and white crappie were dominated by large age 3 year classes.  Northern pike now average 1.0/gillnet, compared to 2.83/gillnet in ?83.  The northern pike population is dominated by young of the year fish, and it appears spawning was good in ?86.  The northern pike population in ?83 was dominated by age 3 fish, with few 4, 5, and 6 year olds.  Yellow perch were not captured during the ?83 survey, but were abundant in \\'86, averaging 34.67/gillnet.  Yellow perch are dominated by age 1 fish, with a few age 2 fish also sampled.  The large black bullhead population that has dominated in recent years is still present.  Bullheads averaged 217.00/gillnet, compared to 235.00/gillnet in ?83.  Many of the bullheads in ?83 ranged in size from 5.5\" - 6.5\", compared to the 7.5\" - 8.9\" bullheads present in ?86.  Other species present in relatively low numbers include largemouth bass, white sucker, and pumpkinseed sunfish.</p>',\n",

Most of these fish are 3 years old or less and the majority should reach 8 inches in the next year.  Yellow perch are very abundant and of excellent size with the average fish being 7.4 inches and weighing around 0.2 pounds.  Black crappie remain very low in abundance.  The average crappie was 5.8 inches and weighed around 0.1 pounds.  Largemouth bass were not well-represented by our sampling but angling reports suggest several strong year-classes are present.  Black bullhead were also found in our sampling with the average fish being 9 inches and 0.6 pounds.  </p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>A standard survey (gill netting, trap netting, and spring night-time electrofishing targeting Largemouth Bass) was conducted at Sleepy Eye Lake in 2016 to monitor the Lake's fish population.  A total of 9 species were sampled, plus Hybrid Sunfish.  On 6/20/16, the lake was not mixed with oxygen dropping below 2 mg/l in 17' of water, limiting fish usage of deeper water.  Water clarity was marginal, with a secchi disk reading of 4.6' due to an algae bloom.  Sleepy Eye was reclaimed with rotenone in 1993 and a significant recreational fishery has been present ever since.  An aeration system was operated during severe winters at Sleepy Eye.  Curlyleaf Pondweed, an invasive aquatic plant, can be abundant in May and June at Sleepy Eye Lake, but usually dies back by July.  Campsites and a fishing pier were available on the north end of the lake.       <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled low numbers (8) Walleye for a catch rate of 1.3/net, which was within the normal range for lakes similar to Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 catch rate was also 1.3/net.  Historical catch rates (n=18) from 1983 to 2016 were mostly low ranging from 0.0 to 1.3/net with an average of 0.2.  The current stocking regime (305 pounds of fall yearlings - one in three years) was initiated in 2012.  The reason for stocking larger fall yearlings, instead of the typical fall fingerlings, was to reduce predation by the lake's abundant predators (Northern Pike and Largemouth Bass).  In 2016, Walleye were 14.7 to 21.7 inches long with an average of 18.3.  Trap nets sampled Walleye up to 25.2 inches in length.  Walleye (gill and trap netted) were age-2 to age-8 with four year classes being present.  Approximately 75% of the gill net aged Walleye matched up with stocked year classes.  Growth was fast.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (54) of Northern Pike for a catch rate of 9.0/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 catch rate was 2.5/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2016 (n=18) were variable ranging from 0.5 to26.5/net with an average of 7.6, indicating moderate recruitment (>5/net and <10/net) most years.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2016 (n=14) ranged from 0.5 to 26.5/net with an average of 9.1.  In 2016, gill netted Northern Pike were 17.8 to35.9 inches long with an average of 23.3.  Approximately 70% of the gill net catch was 21 inches or longer, while 7% were 28 inches or longer, indicating a quality size structure.  Northern Pike were age-2 to age-7 years old with five year classes present.  The current Northern Pike fry stocking regime was 50,000 fry - annually.  The only year that Northern Pike fry were not stocked, from 2009 to 2016, was 2013, due to a shortage that spring.  Approximately 24% of the gill net aged fish were age-3 (2013 year class), indicating that natural reproduction was occurring.  The contributions from stocked fry and natural reproduction, during stocked years, was unknown.  Growth was moderate.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (86) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 14.3/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye .  The 2011 catch rate was 7.3/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2016 (n=18) were highly variable ranging from 0.0 to 139.5/net with an average of 35.6.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2016 (n=14) were also highly variable ranging from 1.5 to 139.5/net with an average of 41.9.  Gill netted Yellow Perch were 5.4 to 9.0 inches long with an average of 6.7.  Approximately 6% of the catch was 8 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure, as far as anglers would be concerned.  Yellow Perch were likely an important forage item for many fish species at Sleepy Eye Lake.   <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled moderate numbers (75) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 12.5/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 catch rate was much higher (34.0/net).  Gill net catch rates from 1983 to 2016 (n=18) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 71.3/net with an average of 12.7.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2016 ranged from 0.0 to 34.0/net with an average of 8.9.  In 2016, gill netted Black Crappie were 4.6 to 9.2 inches long with an average of 6.1.  Approximately 5% of the gill net catch was 8 inches or longer, indicating a poor size structure.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (40) of Black Crappie for a catch rate of 4.4/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 trap net catch rate was 9.8/net.  Trap net catch rates from 1983 to 2016 (n=18) were highly variable, ranging from 0.0 to 169.8/net with an average of 13.6.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2016 (n=14) ranged from 0.0 to 13.6/net with an average of 3.8.  Trap netted Black Crappie were 4.9 to 9.7 inches long with an average of 6.8.  In 2016, Black Crappie were estimated to be age-2 to age-9 with seven year classes present.  Age-2 and age-7 fish accounted for 49% and 38% of the gill net sample, respectively.  Those two year classes could be considered to be moderate in size, while all others were weak.  Growth was slow.      <br> \\n   <br> \\nTrap nets sampled high numbers (421) of Bluegill for a catch rate of 46.8/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 catch rate was 53.0/net.  Catch rates from 1983 to 2016 (n=18) were highly variable ranging from 4.5 to 125.5/net with an average of 36.3.  Catch rates from 1994 to 2016 (n=14) ranged from 14.9 to 71.7/net with an average of 35.5.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were 3.5 to 8.6 inches long with an average of 6.2.  Approximately 75% of the trap net catch was 6 inches or longer while 5% were 7 inches or longer.  In 2016, trap netted Bluegill were age-3 to age-10 years old with eight year classes present.  Age-7 fish made up the bulk (72%) of the trap net aged fish.  Growth was slow, due to the high numbers of fish present.      <br> \\n   <br> \\nSpring night-time electrofishing sampled high numbers (57) Largemouth Bass for a catch rate of 56.0/hr.  This was the third time that electrofishing was used to sample Largemouth Bass at Sleepy Eye Lake.  The catch rates in 2006 and 2011 were 91.4/hr. and 56.0/hr., respectively.  Electrofished Largemouth Bass were 4.9 to 19.7 inches long with an average of 11.3.  Approximately 37% of the catch was 12 inches or longer while 23% were 15 inches or longer.  The catch rate and the size distribution indicated that a quality population was present.  Fish were age-1 to age-11 with eleven year classes being present, indicating somewhat consistent recruitment.  Growth was moderate.     <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled 1 Channel Catfish for a catch rate of 0.2/net.  Historical catch rates (n=16) from 1983 to 2016 were mostly low, ranging from 0.0 to 2.0/net with an average of 0.2.  The Channel Catfish was 29.1 inches long.  Channel Catfish fingerlings were last stocked in 2008.       <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets sampled low numbers (30) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 5.0/net, which was below the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye and the lowest measured in the last 21 years at Sleepy Eye.  The 2011 gill net catch rate was much higher (43.2/net).  Historic catch rates from 1983 to 2016 were mostly high ranging from 0.0 to 235.0/net with an average of 87.8.  In 2016, gill netted Black Bullhead were 6.8 to 12.9 inches long with an average of 9.3.  Trap nets also sampled low numbers (29) of Black Bullhead for a catch rate of 3.2/net, which was within the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye and was the lowest since the 1996 assessment (2.3/net).  Trap nets sampled fish up to 13.9 inches in length.     <br> \\n <br> \\nGill nets did not sample any Common Carp in 2016.  Trap nets sampled low numbers (2) of Common Carp for a catch rate of 0.2/net which was below the normal range for similar to Sleepy Eye .  Common Carp were not netted (gill or trap nets) in 2011, and had not been sampled since 1992 (pre-reclamation).  In 2016, the Common Carp were 24.0 and 28.1 inches long.  It was unknown how this species got back into the lake, particularly at large adult sizes. <br> \\n</p>\",\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>A special assessment was conducted to monitor the Sleepy Eye Lake fishery following the 1993 reclamation.Trap netted bluegill were abundant, unfortunately they only averaged 5.1 inches.  Approximately 8% of the bluegill sampled were at least 6 inches and 5% were at least 7 inches.  Low numbers of northern pike were gill netted ranging in size from 20.3-28.8 inches, averaging 23.6 inches (2.9 pounds).  The 2003 summerkill may be responsible for this lower catch rate.  Northern pike fry have been stocked annually since 1998.  Spring night-time electrofishing is the standard gear for sampling largemouth bass, but was not conducted in 2004.  A total of 1 largemouth was captured in a trap net.  The fish was 20.1 inches and weighed 6.2 pounds.  The relative abundance of this species is unknown.  Only 1 walleye was sampled.  The fish was 16.7 inches long and was from the 2001 year class.  Moderate numbers of black crappie were sampled, but size was small.  Gill netted black crappie averaged 6.4 inches and the longest fish was 7.2 inches.  Moderate numbers of black bullhead were trap netted, with fish averaging 8.2 inches.  Some of the larger black bullhead, up to 13.6 inches, may appeal to anglers.  Channel catfish and carp were not sampled in 2004.    </p>',\n",

Current observations include a diverse assemblage of aquatic vegetation and excellent water clarity.  Locals report excellent fishing for panfish and pike.  The vegetation in the lake has provided good habitat and helps to maintain the water quality that better suits a gamefish population.  It is important to focus on watershed improvements such as stormwater management and shoreline protection in order to preserve the current quality of Sleepy Eye Lake.  Proposed dredging projects could put recent water-quality and fish-community improvements at risk.</p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>Sleepy Eye is a smaller sized lake (240 acres) located adjacent to the City of Sleepy Eye in Brown County. A large city-owned access with a double cement boat ramp is located on the north shore within the Sleepy Eye Sportsmen's Park. Sleepy Eye Lake has 4 miles of shoreline and a maximum depth of 21 feet. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) has divided Minnesota's lakes into 44 different classes based on physical and chemical characteristics. Sleepy Eye is a class 38 lake and another similar lake in the Hutchinson Fisheries Management Area is Ripley Lake in Meeker County. A fishing pier is present at the park on the north side of the lake. <br> \\n <br> \\nSleepy Eye Lake is known as one of the best multi-species fisheries in Brown County and the 2021 netting results confirmed this. Walleye stocking resumed at Sleepy Eye Lake in 2012, but net catches were low in 2016. However, the Walleye catch jumped up dramatically in 2021, with high numbers of nice sized fish being sampled. Walleye averaged 21 inches in length with maximum length being 26 inches. Good numbers of Northern Pike were also netted, averaging 22 inches with maximum length of 33 inches. Big Largemouth Bass were also captured in the gill nets with fish just under 20 inches in length being taken. Black Crappie numbers were down a bit from previous surveys, and lengths were small. Sleepy Eye Lake is not known for its large crappies. Bluegill seemed plentiful, with many smaller sized fish captured. However, some Bluegill were slightly over 7 inches in length. Moderate numbers of Yellow Perch were encountered in the nets. Most of the perch were small, but a few reached 10 inches in length. <br> \\n <br> \\nOther species that anglers may encounter at Sleepy Eye Lake include Black Bullhead and the very rare Channel Catfish. <br> \\n <br> \\nPeople can have significant impacts on lakes and the fish populations they support. Overharvest, lakeshore development, removal of shoreline vegetation, and introductions of invasive species can all adversely affect fish populations. Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are typically moved from infested to non-infested waters by anglers, boaters and lakeshore owners, and can adversely impact lakes and fish populations. To avoid spreading AIS, lake users are required to remove all aquatic plants and animals from their watercraft and drain all lake water from their boat and bait buckets before leaving the lake. If you suspect an infestation of an invasive species in this lake, save a specimen and report it to a local DNR office. Additional information on all of these topics can be found on the DNR website (www.dnr.state.mn.us) or by contacting the Hutchinson Area Fisheries office.</p>\",\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>STATUS OF THE FISHERY:\\nThis population assessment was done to determine the contribution and growth rate of stocked crappie and bluegill.  Black crappie and bluegill ages 2 and 3 were stocked in the fall of 1990 at 10 lb./acre.  Black crappie abundance increased from 2.67/trap net in 1986 to 11.0/trap net.  Black crappie sampled are represented by 1, 3, and 4 year olds.  The four year olds were most abundant.  Stocked crappie, aged prior to stocking, would be ages 3 and 4; it is unclear at this time as to what extent they contributed to the population, but the presence of age 1 fish suggests successful reproduction.  Growth for black crappie is good.  Bluegill abundance remained unchanged from 12.5/trap net in 1986 to 12.75/trap net in 1990.  Bluegill are equally represented by ages 3 and 4 in netting.  This corresponds to the age classes of stocked bluegills, which were aged prior to stocking.  It is suspected that a significant number of bluegills are from the 1990 stocking.  Bluegill have shown good growth and have a favorable size distribution, 6.0-7.9 inches.  Northern pike average 4.00/gill net compared to 1.00/gill net sampled in 1986.  Northern pike are represented by ages 3 and 4.  Northern exhibit fast growth and are evenly distributed from 23.0-33.9 inches.  Yellow perch declined from 34.67/gill net to in 1986 to 13.0/gill net.  Perch are represented by ages 2-4 with most fish 6.5-7.9 inches.  Five channel catfish were sampled and were 14.0-16.9 inches.  Channel catfish were stocked as yearlings in 1988.  Black bullhead remain abundant averaging 163.75/gill net compared to 217.00/gill net in 1986.  Black bullhead appear to be represented by a single year class of 6.5-7.4 inch fish compared to the 7.0-8.9 inch population in 1986.  Carp were sampled for the first time, and occurred at 2.75/trap net.  Source of the carp is unknown, though migration is unlikely because of the complex route the fish would have to travel.  Most of the carp were 12.0-14.9 inches.  Other species sampled in relatively low numbers include pumpkinseed, hybrid sunfish, and largemouth bass.    </p>',\n",

Black crappie abundance is unchanged from 1991, averaging 7.5/trap net and 17.0/gill net compared to 11.0/trap net and 14.0/gill net in 1991.  Black crappie are represented by ages 1-5 with age 1 and 5 most abundant.  Stocked crappies correspond to ages 4 and 5.  Black crappie sampled in 1991 were represented by 1, 3, and 4 year olds.  Growth remains good for age 1 and 2 black crappie, and is average for older fish.  Bluegill abundance has declined from 12.75/trap net in 1991 netting to 4.5/trap net.  Bluegill were represented by 3 and 4 year olds in 1991 netting and correspond to like aged fish stocked in 1990.  Bluegills are now represented by ages 1, 3, and 6, with 4 and 5 year olds most abundant, which correspond to stocked fish.  Northern pike abundance remains unchanged from 1991, 4.0/gill net.  Seven of the thirteen northern pike netted had fin clips, with four of them age 1 and with the remaining age 2, 3, and 4.  Northerns stocked in 1991/1992 were fingerling/adults (296) that were marked with a pelvic clip.  Northerns are dominated by age 1 with fewer 2-6 year olds netted.  Northerns continue to exhibit fast growth.  Six channel catfish corresponding to the 1988 yearling stocking, were sampled.  Yellow perch continue to decline from 34.67/gill net and 13.0/gill net in 1986 and 1991, respectively, to 7.0/gill net.  Yellow perch are well represented by ages 1-3 compared to the 2-4 year olds sampled in 1991.  Black bullhead remain abundant, averaging 171.00/gill net compared to 163.75/gill net in 1991.  Two cohorts seem to be present with the 7.0-9.0 inch fish more abundant than the 4.5-5.5 inch fish.  Carp numbers are increasing with 21 fish netted compared to 15 netted in 1991 (the first year they were sampled).  Other species present in low numbers include pumpkinseed, white crappie, and walleye.</p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': '<p>Ice-out trap netting began on April 15, 2019 at Clear Lake south of Gibbon to evaluate current Northern Pike and Yellow Perch management, which began in late 2016.  Trap nets were set to evaluate Clear\\'s fish population.  Clear Lake has a history of winterkill with the latest event occurring in 2014.  Winterkill frequency is decreasing at Clear Lake, just as it is across southern Minnesota.  Fish populations can fluctuate widely depending on the frequency and severity of the latest winterkill at Clear Lake.  Caution is advised when interpreting this data, as catches from one day netting assessments can be highly variable, and catch rates should not be compared to summer trap net data.  The 2019 net catches were as follows: <br> \\nTrap nets sampled low numbers (12) of Northern Pike for a catch rate of 1.5/net.  Northern Pike were 17.4 to 30.7 inches long with an average of 22.0 inches.  Approximately 58% of the catch was 21 inches or longer.  Northern Pike adults were stocked in 2016, 2017, and 2018.  Enough adult Northern Pike have likely been stocked that so fish should now begin producing natural year classes on their own.  Pike fishing should improve over the next several years.  Northern Pike can typically survive lower winter dissolved oxygen levels (which occasionally occur at Clear Lake) than Walleye and Bluegill can which is why management switched to Yellow Perch and Northern Pike in 2016. <br> \\n <br> \\nTrap nets sampled low numbers (17) of Yellow Perch for a catch rate of 2.1/net.  Yellow Perch were 5.5 to 8.9 inches long with an average length of 7.2 inches.  Yellow Perch were stocked in 2018 and 2019.  Yellow Perch abundance should increase over the next several years with hopes of supplying abundant forage for Northern Pike and perhaps even producing a few \"jumbos\" for anglers. <br> \\nTrap nets sampled low numbers (17) of Walleye for a catch rate of 2.1/net.  Walleye were 8.5 to 19.5 inches long with an average of 14.4 inches.  Clear Lake was last stocked with Walleye fry in 2015, when it was used as a DNR Walleye rearing pond.  Presence of eight fish less than 10.5 inches in length possibly indicated that natural reproduction had occurred at Clear Lake. <br> \\n <br> \\nTrap nets failed to sample any Black Crappie in 2019.  Stockings efforts from 2015 and 2016 may have been unsuccessful, but one day netting surveys can be unreliable, occasionally not sampling fish that were actually present in a lake.     <br> \\nTrap nets sampled low numbers (5) of White Crappie for a catch rate of 0.6/net.  White Crappie were 9.6 to 11.6 inches long with an average of 10.4 inches.  White Cappie were stocked in 2016. <br> \\n <br> \\nTrap nets sampled high numbers of (2,691) Common Carp for a catch rate of 336.4/net, dominating the 2019 catch.  Common Carp were mostly 9.7 to 11.1 inches in length, and a few larger (2 to 3 pound) individuals were also observed in the nets.   <br> \\n <br> \\nTrap nets sampled low to moderate numbers of Black Bullhead (245) for a catch rate of 30.6/net.  Most of the Black Bullhead were estimated to be 5 to 7 inches in length.  <br> \\n <br> \\nTrap nets also sampled low numbers of Bigmouth Buffalo (1), Bluegill (2), and Green Sunfish (1). <br> \\n <br> \\nCurrently, Walleye and Northern Pike will likely provide the best fishing opportunities at Clear Lake, with occasional catches of White Crappie and Yellow Perch also being possible.  The public access on the north shore and the Sibley County Park on the east shore offer good shore fishing opportunities.  Future plans for Clear Lake are a proposed drawdown after a public hearing to reduce rough fish abundance via winterkill, then restocking the lake with Northern Pike and Yellow Perch.  </p>',\n",

The walleye are all yearling fish stocked in the spring of 1987 from Hutchinson area walleye ponds.  The black bullhead population is dominated by fish in the 6.5 to 8.0 inch range.  Black crappies and bluegills are also present from spring 1986 and 1987 stocking of 4 and 5 year old black crappies and 5 and 6 year old bluegills from Hutchison area lakes.  Growth of above gamefish will be evaluated depending on survival from winterkill.  Northern pike numbers are low and future stocking will depend on success of future walleye fishery.  Lake also has significant numbers of 3.5 to 5.5 inch green sunfish.</p>',\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>Fedje Lake, near the town of Madelia in Watonwan County, is a 184 acre lake with a maximum depth of 6 feet.  The management plan from 1992 indicated Fedje was managed primarily for yellow perch.  Fedje Lake has had a history of low oxygen during winter months.  Local reports indicated a substantial winterkill occurred during the winter of 2000.  Trails and Waterways purchased  4 acres in 2001 from the Watonwan Sportsman's club to ensure a  legitimate access which will make fisheries management a possibile.  The first initial survey was done during the week of May 28, 2002 using 1 gill net, 9 trap nets, and 2 seine hauls.No yellow perch were captured in any of the gears.The catch rate for black bullhead in gill nets was within the range expected.  Total lengths ranged from 4.8 to 10.3 inches and averaged 6.2 inches, which indicated the population was dominated by smaller individuals.  The condition of the fish was average.  It is possible that bullhead fishing could be good, however Fedje Lake has a huge fathead minnow base, making fishing more difficult.  The catch rate for common carp in gill nets was greater than expected.  Total lengths in gill nets ranged from 5 to 18 inches and averaged only 8 inches in length.One 11 inch largemouth bass was captured in a trap net.  This fish had hook marks in it's mouth which indicated that this fish was probably an unauthorized stocking.Seine hauls captured fathead minnows, black bullhead, and 1 brook stickleback.No other species were caught in the survey.Eighteen different species of aquatic vegetation were observed which is a rare for many Windom Area lakes.To promote and maintain healthy fish populations, pollution and other inputs need to be controlled.  Fish habitats are directly affected by water quality.  Nutrient, sediment and other waste inputs can drastically alter the biological, chemical, and physical components of a lake.  It is paramount to maintain if not improve the current water quality of Fedje Lake through watershed management to preserve this fishery for future generations to enjoy.Prepared by Ryan Doorenbos       </p>\",\n",

       "     'narrative': \"<p>Fedji Lake, near the town of Madelia in Watonwan County, is a 184 acre lake with a maximum depth of 6 feet.  Fedji Lake historically had a good population of yellow perch.  Fedji has been used as a yellow perch source for stocking Windom Area lakes prior to 2010, however fish management has been limited on Fedji Lake because an official public access was not available.  In 2001, a public access was built which made fisheries management possible.  An initial fish survey was conducted in May 2002; only common carp, black bullhead, and one largemouth bass (suspected illegal stocked fish) were caught indicating a winterkill situation had occurred prior to the survey.  At times abundant aquatic macrophyte community exists (18 species) in Fedji Lake and the lake is the only lake in the Windom Fisheries Management Area with white water lily present.   <br> \\n <br> \\n Fedji Lake has had a history of winterkill.  Local reports indicated a substantial winterkill occurred during the winter of 2000 and 2009.  An aeration system was purchased by the Madelia Sportsmen's Club to maintain the sport fish community.  In collaboration with our office, the system was not installed in 2009 in an effort to reduce/remove common carp through a winterkill.  In the spring of 2009 it was apparent a major winterkill had occurred.  A population assessment was done during the week of June 1st, 2010 using 1 gill net and 9 trap nets.  <br> \\n <br> \\nOnly black bullheads were sampled in the gill net and black bullhead and one yellow perch were sampled in the trap nets.  Total lengths of black bullhead ranged from 5.0 to 8.4 inches with an average of 7.5 inches.  The yellow perch was not measured.  It is apparent that there was a significant winterkill during 2009-2010.  No common carp were sampled and it appears the winterkill has reduced, if not eliminated common carp from Fedji Lake.  Restocking took place right away in the spring of 2010 as walleye fry were stocked and adult yellow perch were stocked in the fall of 2010.  The aeration system was operational during the winter of 2010-2011 and additional stocking will take place in 2011 to add northern pike and black crappie to Fedji Lake (as well as additional walleye).  Given the little biomass of fish in the lake, with little resulting competition for food, the stocked fish should grow well and become fishable size within two years.  The future outlook for fishing at Fedji Lake is good.  <br> \\n <br> \\nPrepared by <br> \\nNate Hodgins <br> \\n</p>\",\n",
